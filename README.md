# A-Simple-Electronic-Piano-on-FPGA
## Implement
 I implemented a simple electronic piano on FPGA(Nexys2 by Xilinx), with a PS/2 keyboard and two buzzers. Written in verilog, this program allows its user to play a tune at the tap of a keyboard.
## How-to
left hand: Shift is C3, Z is D3, ...,M is C4. 
right hand: A is D3, ...,J is C4,...
## Function
Two songs have been pre-stored in this piano: An die Freude and the school song(The Eternal East Wind), switch mode to hear them.
